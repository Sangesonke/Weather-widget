# Weather-widget
A real-time weather widget designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, and forecasts. Built with Python and integrated with a reliable weather API, this widget demonstrates my ability to handle real-time data and API integration. Currently in development, this project showcases my skills in creating dynamic and user-focused applications.
